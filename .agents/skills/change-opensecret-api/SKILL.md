# Change the OpenSecret API

Treat OpenSecret, released SDKs, and affected Maple paths as one versioned
protocol. Preserve existing public behavior unless the task deliberately
changes it.

Normative rules in this skill govern new or changed code; they do not certify
untouched paths. Re-confirm current behavior from source and tests. If an
unrelated path conflicts with a rule, keep that observation task-local and do
not broaden the change without user approval.

## Trace the live contract

Derive the route from current router assembly in `src/main.rs` and its module in
`src/web/`; do not maintain a copied endpoint table. Trace one request through:

1. method, path, middleware order, and established auth context;
2. decryption and typed or extensible request validation;
3. authorization, storage, provider, and usage side effects;
4. status, headers, body or SSE projection, and error mapping;
5. focused tests, released SDK support, and pinned Maple consumers.

Use router assembly as the authority for outer authentication and the route
module as the authority for inner session/decryption middleware. Use
`src/web/openai.rs` for OpenAI-shaped inference routes and
`src/web/responses/` for Responses, conversations, tools, persistence, and
events.

## Preserve transport and identity boundaries

- OpenAI-shaped describes the decrypted payload, not a plaintext wire API.
  Protected routes require the OpenSecret attestation/session protocol and a
  route-appropriate auth context.
- A session protects transport; it does not establish user identity, project
  membership, or storage-key ownership. Bodyless protected routes still
  validate and touch the session.
- JWT and API-key contexts are distinct. Preserve the auth method through
  authorization, persistence eligibility, quota, and usage attribution.
- Hold the session lease for the complete response body or stream. Successful
  protected responses and ordinary stream events remain encrypted according to
  the established client protocol.
- Validate provider-free input before writes. Pinned clients may recover from
  selected session or auth failures by retrying, so a side-effecting change
  needs explicit idempotency or proof that validation precedes the effect.

Inspect `src/web/attestation_routes.rs`,
`src/web/encryption_middleware.rs`, session state in `src/main.rs`,
`src/web/openai_auth.rs`, and `src/jwt.rs` when the change reaches those
boundaries. Do not duplicate their policy inside a handler.

Derive errors from the response type actually returned by the route. Handlers
returning `ApiError` use its mapping in `src/main.rs`; route-local error types
may intentionally differ. For a new or intentionally revised contract, use
stable HTTP semantics and sanitized public bodies. Once a changed stream has
started, use its typed encrypted error event rather than introducing an
unauthenticated plaintext data frame.

## Preserve stateful Responses behavior

Read `src/web/responses/handlers.rs`, `constants.rs`, `events.rs`, and
`context_builder.rs` together with the response/conversation models and
schema. Derive supported fields and event names from those files rather than
from upstream API documentation.

Preserve these ordering rules unless the contract change explicitly replaces
them:

- authenticate, authorize ownership, validate payload/model limits, and build
  context before durable writes;
- check ownership before decrypting or mutating user content;
- keep user content in its established user-key encryption domain;
- persist assistant, reasoning, tool, and output items in emitted order;
- keep event names, decrypted `type`, sequence policy, terminal status,
  cancellation, and durable item ordering consistent.

Do not equate a dropped client stream with explicit cancellation. Define and
test the disconnect points affected by the change, and claim background
continuation only after source and tests establish independent task ownership
at those points.

## Coordinate pinned consumers

Resolve OpenSecret SDK and Maple checkouts independently. Search each available
repository from its own root, without hiding errors, and follow its checked-in
`AGENTS.md` and applicable skills when present. If a consumer checkout is
unavailable, report compatibility as unverified rather than claiming there are
no consumers.

Maple's browser Research path uses Responses/Conversations through the
TypeScript client, while native Agent Mode uses chat completions through the
Rust client. A semantic change intended for both is two protocol integrations,
not one shared wire-field edit. Trace request construction, provider handoff,
persistence, and usage in each affected path.

Use the versions pinned by the selected Maple revision. Update SDK types,
custom-fetch adaptation, native transport allowlists, call sites, mocks, and
fixtures only where the contract reaches them. Test old-client/new-server and
new-client/old-server behavior. Prefer server-first rollout for compatible
additions; use an explicit capability/version gate when either direction cannot
interoperate.

## Validate the changed boundary

Run focused owning-module tests while iterating, then load
`$validate-opensecret` for the complete gate. Exercise protected contracts
through a pinned encrypted client, not plaintext `curl`, and cover each auth
mode the change affects. Include the applicable Maple browser or native path
for a client-facing change.

Label evidence precisely: unit contract, encrypted SDK call, provider-backed
stream, Maple browser, Maple native, or deployed environment. One layer does
not prove the others.
