# Change an OpenSecret provider

Keep providers behind the backend boundary. Clients select public models and
capabilities; OpenSecret owns provider selection, credentials, transport,
provider-model translation, request policy, response normalization, and usage
attribution.

## Trace the live provider path

Derive the current graph from source instead of copying provider or model
inventories:

- `src/model_config.rs`: canonical public IDs, aliases, capabilities, limits,
  visibility, and access.
- `src/provider_routing.rs` and `src/os_flags.rs`: eligible routes and backend
  selection policy.
- `src/proxy_config.rs`: provider endpoints and credentials.
- `src/provider_client.rs`: standard and attested transport, headers,
  streaming, and retry decisions.
- `src/web/openai.rs` and `src/web/responses/`: route-specific request
  rewriting, canonical response projection, tools, and usage.
- `src/web/web_routes.rs` and `src/kagi.rs`: public web contracts and the
  Kagi search/extract adapter.

Trace the changed public model or capability through every affected layer and
its tests. Historical parity notes can explain intent, but current source and
pinned consumers define the contract.

## Preserve the public contract

- Configure public model behavior centrally. Do not add an ID only in a route
  response or selector.
- Keep public IDs provider-neutral and pinned. Resolve aliases before routing,
  translate immediately before send, and canonicalize provider IDs in both
  streaming and non-streaming responses.
- Route from authenticated identity and backend policy. Never accept a
  caller-supplied provider, upstream model ID, routing flag, or another user's
  cache namespace.
- Keep model capability, access, routing, endpoint/credential resolution,
  transport, and route orchestration in their owning layers.
- Treat current-turn reasoning and replay of prior reasoning as separate model
  capabilities. Prove provider-specific behavior before encoding it as policy.

When billing or feature flags affect the path, treat them only as configured
external HTTP APIs. Keep their credentials backend-only and test the changed
call site's unavailable, timeout, denial, fallback, and success semantics.

## Preserve transport and retry safety

Tinfoil and ordinary OpenAI-compatible providers are distinct trust boundaries.
Preserve Tinfoil discovery, attestation, origin-bound TLS, bounded recovery,
and the no-downgrade rule. A new standard provider needs an explicit endpoint,
authentication, confidentiality, and error policy; an OpenAI-shaped API alone
does not establish those properties.

Classify custom provider bases and credential forwarding from parsed current
configuration, not string intuition. Cover exact approved hosts and adversarial
hostnames when changing URL or credential behavior.

Retry only when the transport proves request bytes were not accepted. Do not
replay an ambiguous completion POST after a timeout, response error, provider
status, or partial stream without an explicit idempotency and accounting
design. A refresh task must not retain a request body or inherit one caller's
cancellation accidentally.

## Own outbound data

- Replace inbound authorization with the configured provider credential and
  keep secrets out of URLs, public responses, client configuration, evidence,
  and logs.
- Review forwarded headers and `Connection`-named headers explicitly. The
  backend owns host, framing, content type, credentials, and provider-managed
  request fields.
- Derive cache namespaces from authenticated backend identity. Strip or
  replace caller-controlled provider cache fields according to the selected
  provider policy.
- Log only bounded, allowlisted metadata. Sanitize upstream errors before
  returning them publicly.

Add boundary tests for every changed header, credential, URL, cache, or request
rewrite rule.

## Preserve streams and usage

Parse complete frames, support the established line endings, preserve ordered
JSON chunks, canonicalize model IDs, propagate cancellation, and emit exactly
one terminal condition. Distinguish finish evidence from final usage frames.

Normalize usage once and retain the actual provider, canonical public model,
and established JWT/API-key attribution. Do not publish successful usage for a
partial or unterminated response unless the owning contract explicitly defines
that outcome. Review Responses multi-turn aggregation so a tool loop does not
duplicate usage.

Audio, transcription, and embeddings have independent payload, provider,
limit, and retry policies in `src/web/openai.rs` and
`src/web/audio_utils.rs`; do not generalize chat behavior to them.

## Keep web content untrusted

Keep search and extraction separate. Normalize and authorize public HTTPS URLs
under the current provenance and SSRF policy, and bound all provider results
before placing them in model context. Do not grant URL authority from assistant
text, snippets, diagnostics, or extracted page content. When continuation can
resume tool history, reconstruct authority only from visible persisted inputs
and trusted structured provider output.

## Validate the changed layers

Run focused model, routing, transport, route, usage, or web-safety tests while
iterating, then load `$validate-opensecret`. Live provider probes require
explicit credential, egress, and cost authorization; keep raw evidence outside
the repository and redact it.

Use `docs/tinfoil-rust-sdk-parity.md` for the named Tinfoil live boundary. A
provider-direct probe, encrypted OpenSecret SDK smoke, and Maple smoke prove
different layers; run and report each layer that the change claims.
